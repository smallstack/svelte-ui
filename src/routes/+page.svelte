	title="Svelte 5 & DaisyUI Library"
	description="Tiny library for Svelte 5 and DaisyUI, published as multi entry ESM module and as web components. 
"
/>

<ComponentSubHeader title="Dependencies"></ComponentSubHeader>
This UI library is based on
<ul>
	<li>Svelte 5</li>
	<li>DaisyUI 4.x</li>
</ul>

<ComponentSubHeader title="Purpose"></ComponentSubHeader>
We built this library because at the time of creation there were no libraries that supported Svelte 5,
DaisyUI as well as all needed Forms Inputs.

<ComponentSubHeader title="Web Components"></ComponentSubHeader>
Since this library is also used in legacy stacks (Angular/React projects) all components are also available
as web components. ## License MIT
