# Svelte UI
Tiny library for Svelte 5 and DaisyUI, published as multi entry ESM module and web components. 

## Depenendies 
This UI library is based on 
- Svelte 5 Beta
- DaisyUI 4.x

## Purpose
We built this library because at the time of creation there were no libraries that supported Svelte 5, DaisyUI as well as all needed Forms Inputs. 

## Web Conponents
Since this library is also used in legacy stacks (Angular/React projects) all components are also available as web components.
